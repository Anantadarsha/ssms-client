            is a web-based application designed to simplify and streamline the

            <b> Shree Anantadarsha Sanskrit Ved Vidhyalaya</b>, located in
            Maidhar, Jhapa, Nepal. The need for this system arose from the
            time-consuming and complex process of calculating Grade Point
            Averages (GPA) manually, especially for a large number of students.
            GPA calculation involves multiple mathematical steps and
            comparisons, which this system automates to save time and reduce
            errors.

            The application follows the official GPA calculation guidelines

            <b>National Examination Board (NEB)</b> of Nepal. If you encounter
